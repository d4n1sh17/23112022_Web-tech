# üõí Key Features
## Frontend Functionality
* Dynamic Product Grid: Products are displayed using a responsive grid layout, ensuring optimal viewing across devices.
## Interactive Cart System:
* Add items to the cart using JavaScript's localStorage, ensuring cart data persists across page reloads.
* Remove items dynamically, with the total price updating in real time.
* `Local Storage Integration:` User actions (like adding to or removing from the cart) are stored locally, providing a consistent user experience.

# üíª Technical Details
## HTML & CSS
* `Structured Layout:` Semantic HTML5 elements ensure clean, accessible code.
* `Custom Styling:` CSS3 is used for modern aesthetics, including custom buttons and interactive hover effects.
* `Responsive Design:` The site is fully responsive using flexbox and grid techniques, optimized for both mobile and desktop viewing.

# ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
## Homepage (home.html):
Displays product cards dynamically.
Each "Add to Cart" button triggers a JavaScript function to add the product to localStorage.
## Cart Page (cart.html):
Reads the cart data from localStorage.
Renders the cart items dynamically and calculates the total price in real-time.
Allows users to remove items, updating localStorage and the UI accordingly.

# üöÄ Future Enhancements
`Backend Integration:` Implement user authentication and a database for product management.
`API Connectivity:` Fetch product data dynamically from a server.
`Enhanced UX:` Add animations and transitions for a smoother experience.
